Abstract Factory Pattern vs Factory Method Pattern

Abstract factory adds another level of abstraction to factory method. While factory method abstracts the way objects are created, abstract factory abstracts how the factories are created. 

From implementation point of view, the key difference between the factory method and abstract factory patterns is that factory method is just a method to create objects of a single type, while abstract factory is an object to create families of objects.

Another difference is that the factory method pattern uses inheritance while the abstract factory pattern uses composition. We say that that factory method uses inheritance because this pattern relies on a subclass for the required object instantiation.
